        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a mom of four, grandmother of six, and a woman who's learned that exhaustion and faithfulness can live in the same body. I spent my early motherhood years juggling toddlers and teenagers, soccer practices and ROTC schedules — often alone while my husband worked three jobs and finished school.</p>
        <p>Now I spend my days writing, painting with acrylics, crocheting, and playing piano for my church. I write for women who need someone to remind them that the God who parted the Red Sea is their Father — and He sees every bit of the invisible work.</p>
