      <div class="about-bio">
        <p>I'm Irene Grace Daniels — mom of four, grandmother of six, and a woman who's spent most of her adult life in the trenches of motherhood.</p>
        
        <p>I married my husband when I was 29. He was my first kiss, my first real boyfriend — my first everything. When we married, his two kids were 13 and 15. By our first anniversary, I had a one-month-old baby. By the time that baby turned one, I had <em>another</em> one-month-old baby. (Yes, you read that right. Eleven months apart. I don't recommend it for the faint of heart.)</p>
        
        <p>For those early years, my husband worked three jobs while finishing school, and I held down the fort — which meant being a soccer mom, an ROTC mom, and a mom-of-toddlers, often all by myself. Later, we became a one-car family, and my world became homeschooling, working from home, and figuring out how to keep everyone fed, clothed, and reasonably sane.</p>
        
        <p>I didn't have time for a "daily" quiet time. Some seasons I barely had time to <em>think</em>. But God met me in those moments anyway — in the chaos, in the exhaustion, in the "I have no idea how we're going to make it" prayers.</p>
        
        <h2>Where My Faith Comes From</h2>
        
        <p>I grew up in the faith. My parents came to Christ when I was two, so I don't know anything different. But what shaped me most was watching them — especially my dad. My mom was the worrier (bless her), always fretting about bills and groceries. My dad? Pure faith. I never once saw him scared. When my mom would spiral, he'd just say, <em>"Mom, I don't know how, but God's going to provide. We just have to trust Him."</em></p>
        
        <p>That stuck with me.</p>
        
        <h2>What I Do Now</h2>
        
        <p>Now I'm an empty nester, and I spend my days doing the things I love — painting with acrylics, crocheting, playing piano at church on Sundays, and writing. Always writing.</p>
        
        <h2>Why I Write</h2>
        
        <p>I write for women who are running on empty but still showing up. Women who love Jesus but feel like they're failing at everything. Women who need someone to remind them that the God who parted the Red Sea, who stopped the sun and moon, who healed the sick and raised the dead — <em>that</em> God is their Father. And He sees every bit of the invisible work.</p>
        
        <p>My goal is simple: to point women to a God who is always present, always powerful, and always providing — even when life looks nothing like the plan. To help even one woman live in the true freedom and joy of knowing she is clean, chosen, favored, and loved. Not because <em>she's</em> good, but because <em>He</em> is.</p>
        
        <p>We're all a little Jekyll and Hyde — this dead flesh that tries to rule, and the new creation in Christ that is washed clean. I write for the woman in the middle of that battle.</p>
        
        <p>If that's you, you're in the right place.</p>
