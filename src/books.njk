        <p class="book-subtitle">The "Not So Daily" Devotional for Busy Moms</p>
        
        <p class="book-description"><em>For the mom who's running on empty but still showing up.</em></p>
        
        <p class="book-description">You're tired. You're behind on laundry, low on patience, and wondering if anyone sees the invisible work you do every single day.</p>
        
        <p class="book-description">They do. He does.</p>
        
        <p class="book-description">On a Mission is 365 devotions for the mom who doesn't have time for a "daily" quiet time — and refuses to feel guilty about it. No dates. No schedule. No shame. Just grace for whenever you can grab it.</p>
        
        <p class="book-description">Based on Philippians 4:8, each short reading meets you in the mess and reminds you that the mission you're on matters — even when it doesn't feel like it.</p>
