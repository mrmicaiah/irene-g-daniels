Well, hello there.

If you've found your way here, chances are you're a woman who's trying to hold it all together while quietly wondering if you're the only one who feels like she's barely making it.

Spoiler alert: You're not.

## Why I'm Here

I spent years thinking I was doing faith wrong. I couldn't find time for a "daily" devotional. I felt guilty about the state of my laundry pile. I wondered if God was disappointed in me for not being more... together.

And then one day it hit me: *What if the guilt was never from Him?*

What if the God who knows every hair on my head also knows that I have a toddler who thinks sleep is optional and a teenager who communicates in grunts? What if He's not standing there with a checklist, tapping His foot?

What if He's just... *with me*? In the mess. In the chaos. In the "I have no idea what I'm doing" moments.

## What You'll Find Here

This is a space for real talk. Faith without the filter. Life without the pretense.

I'll share what God's teaching me, the books I'm working on, and probably way too many stories about my kids and grandkids. I'll talk about the hard stuff and the good stuff and everything in between.

Because here's what I've learned: We don't have to have it all figured out. We just have to keep showing up.

And friend? You're already doing that.

So welcome. Pull up a chair. You're in the right place.
